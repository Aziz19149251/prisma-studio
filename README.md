# PrismaStudio 🎨

Instantly transform your favorite images into stunning, exportable color palettes with a premium, designer-grade interface.

## 📖 About The Project

PrismaStudio is a modern web application designed for designers, developers, and creatives. It uses advanced image processing to automatically extract the most dominant and aesthetically pleasing colors from any uploaded photo.

Unlike basic color pickers, PrismaStudio offers an interactive "tactile" experience—you can physically drag color indicators across your image to refine your palette in real-time, all wrapped in a sophisticated "Champagne & Steel Blue" luxury interface.

## ✨ Key Features

🧠 Smart Quantization: Automatically detects and extracts the 5 most dominant colors upon upload.

👆 Interactive Selection: Drag and drop circular indicators anywhere on the image to manually tweak your palette.

💎 Premium UI: A fully responsive, glassmorphism-inspired interface featuring a custom cursor and smooth animations.

## 📤 Professional Export:

One-Click Copy: Copy Hex codes instantly.

CSS Variables: Export the full palette for web development.

JSON Data: Export raw color data for programmatic use.

📱 Fully Responsive: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Vite)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Icons: Lucide React

Logic: Canvas API for pixel manipulation & RGB-to-HEX conversion.
